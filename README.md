A simple singleplayer 2D-game implemented using PyGame (https://www.pygame.org/).

Additionally to PyGame "ptext" (https://github.com/cosmologicon/pygame-text) is used to display text.

I chose a theme with some elememts of the current public discussion about climate change. Maybe this little game can help to 
raise awarness for this important topic.
The project was a fun way to get into touch with some basics of game development, especially when it comes to the use of
graphics and some kind of animation.

Maybe I finde some time to clean up the code some time.

Have fun and care for our environment!
